## Taking Advantage of AI easily with Azure Cognitive Services

**Abstract:** Data Science and Artificial Intelligence are fascinating areas of computing. Microsoft is betting a lot on these new technologies, but we are also aware that data scientists are highly trained professionals, and that not every software developer can create and maintain complex data models, perform linear algebra or purchase expensive GPU rigs to run these models. This is exactly why we created Cognitive services. This suite of services offers pre-trained models that you can use out-of-the-box to perform operations in Vision, Speech, Knowledge, Search and Language. In this session, Laurent Bugnion, a Cloud Developer Advocate with Microsoft will show you how you can use cognitive services to enhance your applications with advanced capabilities, how you can refine the trained models with your own data and how you can integrate Cognitive Services with other Azure services to automate tasks.

## .NET Standard, .NET Core, why and how?

.NET Standard is the new way to create portable assemblies. After learning about portable class libraries in the past years, it is now time to upgrade our game and start coding for Linux, Mac OS and other platforms in addition to Windows. More and more libraries are getting ported to .NET Standard, sometimes really easily and sometimes more painfully. In this session, Laurent Bugnion, the creator of the popular open source MVVM Light Toolkit, will help you understand why .NET Standard can benefit you. We'll talk about ASP.NET Core, see how easily we can containerize and deploy our web applications to Linux on Azure. We will also see what .NET Core 3 means for enterprise application frameworks such as Windows Forms and Windows Presentation Foundation. Finally Laurent will also talk about his experiences converting his open source framework to .NET Standard.

## Azure Functions and Xamarin

One of the most exciting recent additions to Microsoft Azure is called Functions and allows the developer to quickly build and deploy code to the cloud without complicated setup. Also dubbed “serverless computing”, Azure Functions can be triggered by timers, HTTP calls or database operations, and can communicate with other Azure services or mobile and desktop applications such as those made with Xamarin. In this lightning talk, Laurent Bugnion, Cloud Developer Advocate for Microsoft, will give you an introduction to Azure Functions and get you started with this exciting aspect of modern computing.
